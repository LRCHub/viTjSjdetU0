Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right
And aim for my heart
If you feel like
And take me away and make it OK
I swear I'll behave

You wanted control
We waited
I put on a show
I make it
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a shit
And it goes like this

Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk
And I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

Maybe it's hard
When you feel like you're broken and scarred
Nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I'll make you believe
I've got the key

Get in the car
We can ride it
Wherever you want
Get inside it
And you want to steer
I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here
And it goes like this

Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk
And I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

You wanna know how to make me smile
Take control, own me for the night
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this

So watch and learn
I won't show you twice
Head to toe, oh rub me right
But if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
And it goes like this

Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk
And I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
